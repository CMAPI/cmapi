If a widget receives a map.message.progress message but does not have a record of sending a message with the matching messageId, then the widget should ignore the message.  Note that not all channels that support a messageId will report progress between when the message is sent and the return of the map.message.complete.  See each channel’s definition for map.message.progress details object so see if the channel supports progress messages.  Multiple map.message.progress events may be sent for a single message. E.g., every time a new point is added to a line during the processing of a map.feature.draw message, a map.message.progress message will be sent with the latest geometry of the line being drawn as shown in Example 1 below.",
