  "description": "Allows the Map Widget to report progress during the processing of a message.  If a widget receives a map.message.progress message but does not have a record of sending a message with the matching messageId, then the widget should ignore the message.  Note that not all channels that support a messageId will report progress between when the message is sent and the return of the map.message.complete.  See each channelâ€™s definition for map.message.progress details object so see if the channel supports progress messages.  Multiple map.message.progress events may be sent for a single message. E.g., every time a new point is added to a line during the processing of a map.feature.draw message, a map.message.progress message will be sent with the latest geometry of the line being drawn as shown in Example 1 below.",
